Summary result of REML analysis:
Source	Variance	SE
V(G)	0.100469	0.094051
V(e)	0.138337	0.093889
Vp	0.238806	0.015077

The estimate of variance explained on the observed scale is transformed to that on the underlying liability scale:
(Proportion of cases in the sample = 0.399602; User-specified disease prevalence = 0.400000)
V(G)/Vp_L	0.676703	0.631026
