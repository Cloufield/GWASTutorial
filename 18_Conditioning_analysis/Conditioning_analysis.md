Conditioning analysis
---


Multiple association signals could harbore in one loci, especially when observering complex LD structure in the regional plot.
Conditioning on one signal allows to separate the independent signals.

Several ways to perform the conditioning analysis:
* Adding the lead variant to the covariates step-wisely and rerun the association test.
* [GCTA-COJO](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2213).
