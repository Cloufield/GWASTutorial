## Winner's curse definition

Winner's curse refers to the phenomenon that genetic effects are systematically overestimated by thresholding or selection process in genetic association studies. 

!!! info "Winner's curse in auctions"
    This term was initially used to describe a phenomenon that occurs in auctions. The winning bid is very likely to overestimate the intrinsic value of an item even if all the bids are unbiased (the auctioned item is of equal value to all bidders). The thresholding process in GWAS resembles auctions, where the lead variants are the winning bids.

The asymptotic distribution of $\beta_{Observed}$ is:

$$\beta_{Observed} \sim N(\beta_{True},\sigma^2)$$

- $c$ :  Z score cutpoint corresponding to the significance threshold.

It is equivalent to:

$${{\beta_{Observed} - \beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}} \sim N(0,1)$$

We can obtain the asymptotic sampling distribution (which is a [truncated normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution)) for $\beta_{Observed}$ by:

$$f(x,\beta_{True}) ={{1}\over{\sigma}} {{\phi({{{x - \beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}}})} \over {\Phi({{{\beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}}-c}) + \Phi({{{-\beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}}-c})}}$$

when

$$|{{x}\over{\sigma}}|\geq c$$

- $\phi(x)$ : standard normal density function.
- $\Phi(x)$ : standard normal cumulative density function.

From the asymptotic sampling distribution, the expectation of effect sizes for the selected variants can then be approximated by: 

$$ E(\beta_{Observed}; \beta_{True}) = \beta_{True} + \sigma {{\phi({{{\beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}}-c}) - \phi({{{-\beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}}-c})} \over {\Phi({{{\beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}}-c}) + \Phi({{{-\beta_{True}}\over{\sigma}}-c})}}$$

- $\beta_{Observed}$ is biased. 
- The bias is dependent on $\beta_{True}$, SE $\sigma$, and the selection threshold.
