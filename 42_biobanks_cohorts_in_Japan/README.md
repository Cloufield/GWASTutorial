# Large-scale Biobanks and Cohorts

Large-scale biobanks are essential resources for GWAS and genetic research, providing access to genetic data, phenotypic information, and health records from hundreds of thousands to millions of participants. This document provides an overview of major biobanks and cohorts worldwide.

## Major Global Biobanks

### UK Biobank

**Website**: https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/

UK Biobank is one of the largest and most comprehensive biobanks in the world, with genetic and health data from over 500,000 participants recruited across the United Kingdom. It includes:
- Whole-genome sequencing data
- Exome sequencing data
- Genotyping array data
- Extensive phenotypic data including medical records, imaging, and lifestyle factors
- Longitudinal follow-up data

### All of Us Research Program

**Website**: https://allofus.nih.gov/

The All of Us Research Program is a large-scale research initiative in the United States aiming to enroll one million or more participants. It focuses on:
- Diverse population representation
- Whole-genome sequencing
- Electronic health records
- Survey data
- Physical measurements

### FinnGen

**Website**: https://www.finngen.fi/en

FinnGen is a Finnish biobank combining genetic data with comprehensive health registry data from over 500,000 Finnish participants. Key features:
- Nationwide health registry linkage
- Whole-genome sequencing
- Focus on rare diseases and population-specific variants
- Public summary statistics available

### Estonian Biobank

**Website**: https://genomics.ut.ee/en/content/estonian-biobank

The Estonian Biobank (Estonian Genome Center) includes genetic and health data from over 200,000 Estonian participants, representing a significant portion of the Estonian population.

### deCODE Genetics (Iceland)

**Website**: https://www.decode.com/

deCODE Genetics has sequenced and analyzed the genomes of a large proportion of the Icelandic population, providing unique insights into population genetics and disease associations.

### China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB)

**Website**: https://www.ckbiobank.org/

CKB is a large prospective cohort study in China with over 500,000 participants, including genetic data and extensive lifestyle and health outcome information.

### Biobank Japan

**Website**: https://biobankjp.org/en/

BioBank Japan (BBJ) is one of the largest disease-focused biobanks in Japan, with genetic and clinical data from over 200,000 participants across multiple disease categories.

## Biobanks in Japan

### The Big Three Biobanks in Japan

There are 3 biobanks in Japan that are relatively large in terms of samples and comprehensiveness of data:

- **BioBank Japan (BBJ, バイオバンク・ジャパン)**: https://biobankjp.org/en/
- **Tohoku Medical MegaBank (TMM, 東北メディカル・メガバンク)**: https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/
- **National Center Biobank Network (NCBN, ナショナルセンター・バイオバンクネットワーク)**: https://ncbiobank.org/en/

### Relatively Small in Scale but Distinctive Cohorts

#### Hisayama Study

**Website**: https://www.hisayama.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/

A long-running community-based cohort study in Japan focusing on cardiovascular disease and dementia.

#### Nagahama Study

**Website**: https://zeroji-cohort.com/project/index.html

A community-based cohort study in Nagahama, Japan, with comprehensive health and genetic data.

## Other Notable Biobanks

### 23andMe Research

**Website**: https://research.23andme.com/

23andMe has collected genetic and self-reported health data from millions of customers, with many participants consenting to research use.

### Million Veteran Program (MVP)

**Website**: https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/

A large-scale research program in the United States focusing on veterans, with genetic and health data from over 800,000 participants.

### Generation Scotland

**Website**: https://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland

A family-based cohort study in Scotland with genetic and health data from over 24,000 participants.

## Key Considerations for Biobank Data

When working with biobank data, important considerations include:

- **Population diversity**: Representation of different ancestries and populations
- **Data access**: Requirements, approval processes, and data sharing policies
- **Phenotype quality**: Depth and accuracy of phenotypic measurements
- **Sample size**: Statistical power for different types of analyses
- **Longitudinal data**: Availability of follow-up and time-series data
- **Ethics and consent**: Participant consent models and ethical frameworks
