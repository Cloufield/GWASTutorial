# Heritability (under construction)

Heritability is a a term used in genetics to describe how much phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variation.

For any phenotype, its variation $Var(P)$ can be modeled as the combination of **genetic effects** $Var(G)$ and **environmental effects** $Var(E)$.

$$
Var(P) = Var(G) + Var(E)
$$

## Broad-sense Heritability

The **broad-sense heritability** $H^2_{broad-sense}$ is mathmatically defined as :

$$
h^2_{broad-sense} = {Var(G)\over{Var(P)}}
$$


## Narrow-sense Heritability

**genetic effects** $Var(G)$ is composed of multiple effects including **additive effects** $Var(A)$, dominant effects, recessive effects, epistatic effects and so forth.

Narrrow-sense heritability is defined as: 

$$
h^2_{narrow-sense} = {Var(A)\over{Var(P)}}
$$
